#some concerns in this api; my questions actually: 
1> SUPPOSE YOU HOSTED THE API HOW WOULD AN API CONSUMER LIKE ME CONSUME THE IMAGES AND DOCUMENTS? 
2> AND HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TO INTEGRATE IMAGES AND DOCUMENTS IN THIS API?? 
3> IF ERROR OCCURS THERE MUST BE GLOBAL ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE BY EXPRESS 
4> EFFICIENT ERROR HANDLING WILL ENSURE SMOOTH API CONSUMPTION 
5> MAYBE USING ES6 JS, CSS IS BEST STRATEGY FOR ALL TEAM
6> PLEASE HOST THIS API TO A BACKEND UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT 

REGARDS; AVIKING
